I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca'>University of Waterloo</a>, funded by <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/sophiespirkl/'>Sophie Spirkl</a>.\
I will soon start as a Junior Faculty (Instructor) in the <a href='https://www.math.princeton.edu'>Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href='https://www.princeton.edu'>Princeton University</a>.

I completed my PhD in <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/'>Combinatorics and Optimization</a> at the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca'>University of Waterloo</a> between 2020 and 2024.\
My thesis was: _<a href='https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/0ff1e564-5de5-48bd-9ffc-58bd5950c99b'>Foreshadowing the Grid Theorem for Induced Subgraphs</a>_.\
My advisor was <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/sophiespirkl/'>Sophie Spirkl</a>. 

Currently, my research is in combinatorics and graph theory. I am especially interested in structural graph theory (mostly induced subgraphs and graph minors, and sometimes algorithms).\
Broadly, I am also interested in topology, number theory and category theory.

"If there is one thing in mathematics that fascinates me more than anything else (and doubtless always has), it is neither 'number' nor 'size,' but always form. And among the thousand and one faces whereby form chooses to reveal itself to us, the one that fascinates me more than any other and continues to fascinate me, is the structure hidden in mathematical things."

"... It's [all about] the form. Well, form is the mold that can be made to be a very uninteresting factor. But in Beethoven's case, the form is all because it is a case of what note succeeds every other note, and it's alway the right next note."
